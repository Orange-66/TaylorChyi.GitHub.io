    <url>/2020/05/26/%E3%80%8CDoddle%20Shadow%E3%80%8D%20Mental%20Health/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>On a whim, we teamed up with three other students to participate in the 2020 College WeChat Applet Development Competition. However, due to unfamiliarity with WeChat applet development, the difficulty of online collaboration, and coinciding with practical training (time constraint), the late-stage procrastinators ended up catching up with our work in the week before submission, so the completion of our work was still lacking.</p>
<p>The project used <a href="https://github.com/weilanwl/ColorUI">ColorUI</a>，and the Stage-Music module drawn on the <a href="https://github.com/hank583746309/wmusic">this project</a>，I would like to express our sincere thanks!</p>

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>The “Doddle Shadow” is a WeChat app dedicated to solving the psychological subhealth problems prevalent in our society, thus helping users to improve their self-awareness, explore their psychological potential and get out of the psychological haze.</p>
<p>The main users of “Doddle Shadow” are people who are under high psychological stress and lack psychological treatment and self-reduction channels. “It is divided into three functional modules: psychological assessment, tree hole and spiritual station. The psychological assessment module provides users with a psychological assessment questionnaire to make a comprehensive assessment of the user and establish a psychological profile of the user to quickly help users understand their psychological status. The Tree Hole module provides an outlet for users to talk about their troubles, maximizing the release of their psychological pressure, while allowing them to receive encouragement and help from other users. The Mind Station module provides users with stress-reducing music as well as psychological articles, knowledge and therapies, so that users can conduct self-psychological guidance and self-stress reduction.</p>

<h2 id="functions"><a href="#functions" class="headerlink" title="functions"></a>functions</h2><p>(1) output scenic distribution map The system should combine the attractions and paths, generate the adjacency table and the adjacency matrix, and show a more intuitive form to visitors and administrators. (2) Attractions search The system should take a reasonable way to search for attractions, and give hints when the data input by visitors is empty. When visitors enter keywords, the system should output all the attractions containing the keywords. (3) Attractions sorting The system should sort the attractions quickly according to their hotness and the number of turns of attractions and display them to the visitors. (4) Query the shortest path between attractions The system should query the shortest path according to the two attractions inputted by tourists, and display the path to tourists. (5) Query guide road map The system should plan a guide road map according to the starting point and ending point inputted by tourists, and should give the corresponding prompt if it does not exist. (6) Add and delete attractions and paths The system should be able to add and delete attractions and paths and persist the data. (7) Publish and display announcements The system displays announcements to visitors and publishes announcements through the administrator, and the announcement data should be persistent. (8) Management of parking lot: parking and exit The system should manage the parking and exit of the parking lot through the administrator, and when the parking lot is full, the cars should be parked in the right-of-way. There is only one gate in the parking lot, and it is a long and narrow passage. (9) Administrator login</p>

    <title>「LAPS」Doppler Spectrum Analysis System</title>
    <url>/2021/08/26/%E3%80%8CLAPS%E3%80%8DDoppler%20Spectrum%20Analysis%20System/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>The system mainly implements functions including user information management, patient information creation, batch creation, condition search, information viewing, image viewing, information entry, information export, patient image viewing, batch import, deletion, manual edge marking, automatic edge marking, left atrial pressure value calculation based on deep learning model, and system customization. In the process of designing and implementing this system, the PyTorch deep learning development framework is used to complete the model training for left atrial pressure calculation, and the PyQt 5 GUI development framework is used to complete the writing of the interface and realize the visual operation interface, which can run under multiple platforms of Mac and Windows at the same time by the PyQt 5 feature.</p>

<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>Left atrial pressure is an important hemodynamic parameter. Currently, the main clinical methods used are catheter method to measure left atrial pressure or small pulmonary artery Gaston’s pressure instead of left atrial pressure, both of which are invasive examinations. If Doppler spectrum is used to measure left atrial pressure, it can be a non-invasive test. However, if Doppler spectrum is analyzed manually to calculate left atrial pressure, it is not only unclear but also requires physician’s experience, so it is not easy to be used in medical field.</p>
